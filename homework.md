Generics Questions
------------------

1. What is one benefit of using generics in Java classes?

2. Name an example of a generic class that we have used in Java?
    - ArrayList.

3. What is the syntax for declaring a generic class?

    }

4. At what point does the generic type get specified?

5. Can generic types be of primitive type?

6. Can a generic class take more than one type parameters?
    - Yes, e.g., 'class Class<T, V>'.
